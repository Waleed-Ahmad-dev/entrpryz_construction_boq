# Entrpryz Construction BOQ

**Construction Bill of Quantities Management for Odoo**

This module provides a comprehensive solution for managing Bill of Quantities (BOQ) in construction projects within Odoo. It is designed to help construction companies estimate costs, track budgets, and manage the complete approval lifecycle of their project's BOQs with precision and ease.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Seamless Project Integration**: Directly link your BOQs to existing Odoo Projects, ensuring all data is centralized.
- **Automatic Analytic Accounting**: The module automatically associates BOQs with the project's analytic account, enabling precise financial tracking and reporting.
- **Structured & Flexible BOQs**:
  - **Sections**: Organize your BOQ into logical groups (e.g., "Foundation", "Framing", "Electrical") using sections.
  - **Notes**: Add explanatory notes directly within the line items for better clarity.
- **Detailed Cost Categorization**: Classify every line item into specific cost types:
  - Material
  - Labor
  - Subcontract
  - Service
  - Overhead
- **Robust Approval Workflow**: Manage the lifecycle of your BOQ with a strict state machine:
  - **Draft**: Initial creation and editing phase.
  - **Submitted**: Sent to management for review.
  - **Approved**: Validated by authorized personnel (locks the BOQ against major changes).
  - **Locked**: Finalized state for execution and consumption.
  - **Closed**: Archived or completed BOQs.
- **Versioning Support**: Maintain multiple versions of a BOQ for the same project to track revisions and history.
- **Smart Budget Calculation**: Automatically computes total budgets based on quantities and estimated rates.
- **Audit Trail**: Built-in tracking of who created, approved, and modified the documents.
