# Entrpryz Construction BOQ Module

## 1. Overview

The **Entrpryz Construction BOQ** (Bill of Quantities) module is a robust Odoo 18 application designed to streamline the financial management of construction projects. It enables construction companies, contractors, and project managers to create detailed budget estimations, track revisions through a rigorous approval workflow, and monitor actual consumption against planned budgets in real-time.

By bridging the gap between Project Management (`project`) and Accounting (`stock_account`, `account`), this module ensures that every material cost, labor hour, and overhead expense is accounted for and linked to specific analytic accounts.

## 2. Key Features

### 🏗️ Project-Centric Design

- **Direct Integration**: Every BOQ is strictly linked to an Odoo `Project` and an `Analytic Account`, ensuring financial integrity.
- **One Active BOQ Policy**: To prevent conflicting budgets, the system enforces a strict rule where only _one_ BOQ can be in an "Approved" or "Locked" state per project.
- **Task Linkage**: BOQ lines can be mapped to specific Project Tasks, allowing granular tracking of costs per activity using `activity_code`.

### 🔄 Advanced Versioning & History (Copy-on-Write)

- **Automatic Snapshots**: The module utilizes a "Copy-on-Write" mechanism. If a locked or submitted BOQ needs modification, the system automatically:
  1.  Archives the current version as a snapshot.
  2.  Increments the version number (v1 → v2).
  3.  Creates an audit trail linking the revisions.
- **Revision History**: Users can view the full history of a BOQ, comparing previous snapshots with the current active version to see exactly what changed and why.

### 💰 Comprehensive Budgeting

- **Hierarchical BOQ**: Organize costs using **Sections** (e.g., "Substructure", "Superstructure") and **Notes** for better readability.
- **Multi-Cost Types**: Categorize expenses into:
  - `Material`: Tangible goods.
  - `Labor`: Manpower costs.
  - `Subcontract`: Outsourced work.
  - `Service`: Professional services.
  - `Overhead`: Indirect costs.
- **Currency Support**: Full multi-currency support inherited from the parent Company settings.

### 📊 Consumption & Variance Tracking

- **Planned vs. Actual**: Each line item tracks:
  - **Budget Amount**: Quantity × Estimated Rate.
  - **Consumed Amount**: Actuals tracked via integration (e.g., Purchase Orders).
  - **Remaining Amount**: Visual indicators turn red when over budget.
- **Over-Consumption Control**: Optional strict enforcement to prevent exceeding budgeted quantities without explicit manager approval.

### 🛡️ Security & Access Control

- **Multi-Company**: Fully supports multi-company environments with record rules ensuring users only see BOQs for their allowed companies.
- **Role-Based Access**:
  - `User`: Can create and view BOQs.
  - `Manager`: Can approve, lock, and unlock BOQs.
  - `Finance Head`: Can authorize over-consumption.

## 4. Installation & Configuration

### 4.1. Prerequisites

Ensure the following Odoo Community/Enterprise modules are installed:

- `project`
- `stock_account`
- `purchase`

### 4.2. Installation Steps

1.  Clone this repository into your Odoo `addons` path.
2.  Restart the Odoo service.
3.  Log in as Administrator.
4.  Go to **Apps**, search for `Entrpryz Construction BOQ`, and click **Activate**.

### 4.3. Post-Installation Configuration

1.  **User Groups**: Go to _Settings > Users & Companies > Users_. Assign the "Construction / Manager" group to users who need approval rights.
2.  **Analytic Accounts**: Ensure your Projects have valid Analytic Accounts configured, as the BOQ relies on them for cost allocation.

## 5. User Guide

### 5.1. Creating a Bill of Quantities

1.  Navigate to **Construction > BOQs**.
2.  Click **New**.
3.  Select the **Project**. The **Analytic Account** will auto-fill.
4.  Set the **Company** (if strictly defined).
5.  Save to create a Draft (Version 1).

### 5.2. Defining the Budget (Lines)

1.  **Add Sections**: Break down the project (e.g., "Phase 1: Civil Works").
2.  **Add Lines**:
    - **Product**: Optional. Selecting a product auto-fills the UoM and Cost.
    - **Cost Type**: Crucial for reporting. Select `Material`, `Labor`, etc.
    - **Task**: Link to a specific project task for granular tracking.
    - **Rate & Qty**: Enter your estimates.
3.  **Expense Account**: Ensure the correct GL account is set (defaults from Product Category).

### 5.3. Approval Workflow

1.  **Submit**: When ready, click `Submit`. The status changes to `Submitted`.
2.  **Approve**: A manager reviews the budget.
    - If valid, they click `Approve`.
    - _Constraint_: You cannot approve if another BOQ for this project is already active.
3.  **Lock**: Finalizes the budget, making it read-only.
4.  **Revise**: If changes are needed after approval:
    - Edit the BOQ.
    - The system _automatically_ creates a revision (v1 -> v2) upon save.
    - The old v1 is archived, and v2 becomes the new Draft/Submitted version.

### 5.4. Tracking Consumption

Consumption is typically recorded automatically via Purchase Orders or Stock Picking if configured (custom implementation required for auto-posting).

- **Manual Entry**: You can manually add entries to the `consumption_ids` table if enabled in the view.
- **Review**: Check the "Remaining Amount" column on BOQ lines. Negative values indicate over-budget items.

## 6. Troubleshooting

- **Error: "BOQ Line analytic account must match..."**
  - _Fix_: Ensure the Project's analytic account matches the one set on the BOQ lines. If you changed the Project, re-save to update lines.
- **Error: "An active BOQ with this version already exists..."**
  - _Fix_: You might have manually duplicated a BOQ without archiving the old one. Archive the old version first.
- **Cannot Delete Line**:
  - _Reason_: If the BOQ is linked to actual consumption records, Odoo prevents deletion to maintain audit integrity. Archive the line instead or reverse consumption.
